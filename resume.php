                            automation developed using the C# programming language and gained knowledge about the
                            software. These applications had interfaces designed to meet operator needs for monitoring
                            and controlling industrial processes. Information exchange between the PLC and the
                            application was conducted via serial port communication.</li>

                            technologies such as SQLite and SQL. During this process, I gained knowledge in database

                            design, component selection, and assembly.</li>
